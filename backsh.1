.TH backsh 1 "December 14, 2024" "1.0" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
backsh \- Backup shell

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B backsh
.I directory
.I filename

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B backsh
reads data from its standard input and writes the data to a file
in the specified
.I directory
with the specified
.I filename
prepended by the current timestamp in the format
.BR "YYYYMMDDZHHMMSS" .
The resulting file will be located at:

.IR "directory/YYYYMMDDZHHMMSS-filename" .

The program creates files with permissions set to 0600.

It is intended to be specified as a shell in a remote backup host computer,
allowing potentially untrusted clients to backup data to the
specified directory,
without providing them remote access to a command shell or the ability to
delete existing backup files.
Note that it is still possible for a compromised backup client
to cause a denial of service attack by writing too many files,
or by filling up the backup host's disk space.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I directory
Specifies the target directory where the file will be created.
This directory must already exist and be writable by the shell's
user.
.TP
.I filename
Specifies the base name of the file to be created.
The current timestamp will be prepended to this name,
as a measure to prevent the deletion of old existing backup files.
